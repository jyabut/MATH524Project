>By using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in R, photos can be compressed to save storage space without compromising on the details in the image itself. The hopes were to create an app with a dropdown menu that provides percentages of how much of the photo the user would like to keep. This would allow users to quickly compress the photo. Through SVD, a photo is broken down into matrices containing metadata of how to reconstruct the photo. It was discovered that a small portion of the metadata can recreate a photo. From there, different photos were evaluated, and varying amounts of metadata were used to recreate them. This gave our team ideas for the compression levels, but there were conflicting decisions. Due to varying amounts of details, the photos could not be compressed at the same levels, and it occasionally came down to personal preference. To have a fully functioning app, a maximum amount of compression will be provided to the user based on the photoâ€™s dimensions.
